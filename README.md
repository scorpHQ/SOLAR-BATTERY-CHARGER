# SOLAR-BATTERY-CHARGER
DIY - SOLAR BATTERY CHARGER

Hi Everyone, I am back again with this new tutorial.

In this tutorial I am going to show you how to charge a Lithium 18650 Cell using TP4056 chip utilizing the solar energy or simply the SUN.

Wouldnâ€™t it be really cool if you can charge your mobile phones battery using the sun instead of a USB charger. You can also use this project as a DIY portable power bank.

The total cost of this project excluding the battery is just under $5. The battery will addup another $4 to $5 bucks. So the total cost of the project is some what around $10. All components are available on my website for sale for really good price, the link is in the description below.
